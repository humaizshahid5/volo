                        VOLO may collect the following information from users of our site: first name, last name, street address, area and city, phone and contact numbers, e-mail address, GPS location (mobile site) (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").
                        In addition, VOLO may collect information regarding VOLO account holders' past VOLO orders, favourite restaurants, customer service inquiries, service/restaurant reviews and certain social networking preferences (e.g. pages you "Like" or "Recommend").
                        VOLO also uses web analytics software to track and analyse traffic on the site in connection with VOLO advertising and promotion of VOLO services. VOLO may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including PII.
                        Non-Personally Identifiable Information (or "Non-PII") is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We and our third party service providers may collect Non-PII from you, including your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser and demographic data, for example your location, gender and date of birth and we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. We and our third party service providers may also use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our Site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
                        P Addresses are the Internet Protocol addresses of the computers that you are using. Your IP Address is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever users visit the Site, along with the time(s) of such visit(s) and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.

                        VOLO uses PII to create users' VOLO accounts, to communicate with users about VOLO services, to offer users additional services, promotions and special offers and to charge for purchases made through VOLO. Users may affirmatively opt-out of receiving promotional communications from VOLO, users can unsubscribe from out promotional list anytime from any email sent by VOLO. VOLO may also use PII to enforce VOLO terms of use and service.
                        OLO uses cookies to remember users on the site and to enhance users' experience on the site. For example, when users with VOLO accounts return to the site, cookies identify those users and allow the site to provide certain user-specific information such as VOLO login information, choice of website language and country selection in addition to any other information we might collect in the future. VOLO does not sell the information it collects to third parties. VOLO shares collected PII to third-party vendors and service providers with whom VOLO works to provide application programming interfaces ("APIs") and other functions for the site in connection with the delivery of VOLO services. In addition, VOLO shares users' VOLO order content, special order instructions, first and last name, street address and telephone number with restaurants where users' orders are placed to the extent necessary to process those orders. VOLO may also disclose PII to third parties such as attorneys, collection agencies, tribunals or law enforcement authorities pursuant to valid requests in connection with alleged violations of VOLO terms of use and service or other alleged contract violations, infringement or similar harm to persons or property.
                        User generated content posted through the site such as service/restaurant reviews and certain social networking preferences (e.g. pages you "Like" or "Recommend") may be viewed by the general public. Accordingly, VOLO cannot ensure the privacy of any PII included in such user generated content.
                        Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non PII, which does not personally identify you, with our affiliates and with other third parties, for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined.
                        IP Addresses. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the site. We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose PII. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-PII, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

                        When you place an order through the website, you are required to select a method of payment. VOLO is not interested in your debit/credit card information nor do store any of your debit/credit information, since orders could be paid at the door directly to the restaurant through methods of payment such as cash, credit card or payment checks. Online debit/ credit card payment is also an option and for some restaurants it can be the only method of payment. For transactions with online debit/credit cards, we transmit your entire card information to the appropriate debit/credit card company in an encrypted format with globally accepted rules and applications during order processing. Upon your choice, we keep a part of your card information in an encrypted format, taking precaution to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards over your credit card information.
