                <p>Any member of VOLO has a “user name” and “password” which are determined by the member herself/himself. The "user name" is personal to the member and the same “user name” is not given to two different members. The “password” is only known by the user. The user can change the password at any time. It is solely under the responsibility of the user to select and protect the password. VOLO is not liable for any problems, which may arise from the use of password. VOLO informs the user about the promotions, which take place in the user’s area and from which the user may benefit, by app notifications and in some cases, by email. VOLO does not share the user information with the third party companies – the phone number may be shared with the shop which deals with take-out foods, in order to provide a faster and correct delivery. For the user to connect to the services, which require a membership of the VOLO app, the user must enter the user name and password. This process is called “login” to VOLO.</p>

                <p>
                    Members' passwords should be kept confidential at all times, and must not be shared or disclosed to anyone. You are responsible for all activities and orders that occur or are submitted through your membership. If you know or suspect that someone has knowledge of your password then you should contact us immediately. 
                    You may not use the site for any unlawful or unauthorised purpose, including without limitation to: 
                    Distributing any unlawful, libellous, abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene or otherwise objectionable material 
                    Transmitting material that constitutes a criminal offence, results in civil liability or otherwise breaches any laws, regulations or codes of practice.
